I recently graduated from the University of St. Thomas (DEC 2021) with a BS in computer science. I am currently working as a software engineer for Travelers Insurance within their Technology Leadership Development Program. I am also a veteran of the 82nd Airborne Divison. I have a passion to create operational, efficient, and secure software. I have tried and true teamwork and leadership experience. I am highly motivated, attentive to detail, and enthusiastic in my work to produce secure and reliable software. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn here: <a>https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-gartner-42123b204/</a>. I would like to share my top 3 projects to showcase for my portfolio.


Project 1:
The first project is my personal website I created for Web Development. It was one of my useful projects being that I am able to show this to potential employers and include it on my resume. It contains four static webpages: a homepage, resume page, projects page, and fun facts page. The St. Thomas value it best fits is personal attention because it is a personalized website that could be refined a bit more and used in alot of professional situations. It can be found here: <a>https://github.com/Aaron-Gartner/Aaron-Gartner.github.io</a>. 


Project 2:
The second project I would like to share with you is a bit more of a dynamic webpage with the functionality of a dynamic web server. It was a cool project that allowed us to explore the St. Thomas value of sustainability while coding a great looking webpage with a basic graphing node module. It demonstrates how webpage templates can be dynamically filled using minimal information/queries from a server. It can be found here: <a> https://github.com/Aaron-Gartner/DynamicWebServer</a>.

Project 3:
The final project I would like to showcase is one from my operating systems class. It demonstrates how a modern operating system can utilize different scheduling algorithms to complete certain tasks/processes. It was one of the most satisfying projects to complete due to the fact it utilized a count-down so you could watch as each process was moved on a core of a cpu run for a certain amount of time (depent on the type of scheduling algorithm you were utilizing) The St.Thomas value it most connects with is the pursuit of truth. It accomplishes this by de-mystifying how processes on a modern day operating system are handled. It can be found here:  <a>https://github.com/Aaron-Gartner/os-scheduling</a>
